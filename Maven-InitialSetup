Maven is downloadable as a zip file at http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi. 

Only the binaries are required, so look for the link to apache-maven-{version}-bin.zip or apache-maven-{version}-bin.tar.gz.

Once you have downloaded the zip file, unzip it to your computer. Then add the bin folder to your path.

To test the Maven installation, run mvn from the command-line:


mvn -v
